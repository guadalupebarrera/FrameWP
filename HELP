FrameWP 1.0 beta

/*
--------------------------------------------
	IMPORTANT
--------------------------------------------
*/

This version of FrameWP was tested in WordPress 5.6.2 Multisite with Force Login activated. 
It works, but this release is not perfect.

- This plugin is not SEO-ready as of yet. 
- Users can navigate from page to tags, categories, and user pages without getting booted out.
- Only admins can navigate to posts from anywhere in the backend. Contributors, editors, etc will get the boot.

Obviously, you should limit your use of this plugin to test servers.

FrameWP will automatically create three new pages in WordPress when activated:
- Landing Page: The first page visitors will see when go to your-wordpress-website.com
- Content Page: A simple page that will present all your content in an Iframe
- All Posts: Shows all posts.

This plugin makes use of templates; however, these will have to be set manually before they can used.

Assign the appropriate template to each page accordingly:
- Landing Page: FrameWP Landing Page
- Content Page: FrameWP Iframe Page

Next, go to your Reading settings in WordPress and assign each page like so:
- Front Page: Landing Page
- Posts Page: All Posts

Finally, go to FrameWP settings and check to make sure that everything looks like this:
- Landing Page: Landing Page
- Content Page: Content Page
- Posts Page: All Posts
