# FrameWP
FrameWP is a WordPress plugin built to offer users with a minimalist browsing experience while giving webmasters an additional tool to protect their photo and video content. This plugin forces casual users to browse a WordPress website in window mode. The aim is to limit user access to browser extensions that enable them to effortlessly download photos and videos, even when other powerful measures such as encrypted HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) have been deployed. Nonetheless, FrameWP is most effective when used with plugins that disable right-click functionality, and plugins that offer HLS integration. Think of FrameWP as just another obsticle.
