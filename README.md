# FrameWP
FrameWP is a WordPress plugin that offers site administrators an additional layer of photo and video content protection while offering users a minimalist browsing experience. This plugin forces casual users to browse a WordPress website in window mode. The aim is to limit user access to browser extensions that enable them to effortlessly download photos and videos. FrameWP is most effective when used with plugins that disable right-click functionality, and plugins that offer HLS integration for streaming servers. Think of FrameWP as just another obsticle.
